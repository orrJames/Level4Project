14. Reflective Learning for Beginner Programmers (ID: 17724)
- Jeremy Singer
- There are loads of online programming tutorial systems - e.g. tryhaskell, learnpython, tryruby, ... they are simple web-based interactive programming sandboxes #where novice developers can explore how to use a language. This project involves extending one of these online programming tutorial systems to add a facility for #learners to record their reflective notes about what they have learned in that lesson. The note is stored with the tutorial page and can be revisited later, for revision.
The two key aspects of the project are:
o 1) designing an effective integration between the programming tutorial and the reflective note-taking system
o 2) evaluating whether keeping reflective notes improves learner performance
This will require a large-scale user study, which we might be able to run with Level 1 students or with an online learning community on Coursera or FutureLearn.
